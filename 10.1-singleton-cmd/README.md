# SingletonSample (Main)

Singleton Framework within Terminal to set a syncing variable.

## Singleton

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern in software engineering that ensures only one instance of a class can exist, managed by a private static attribute. This pattern provides global access to a single instance and helps manage resources or information centrally. The pattern is implemented by declaring the class constructor private and making the single instance available through a static method.
